# KBC-Python-App
Description:
The KBC Python App is an interactive command-line application hosted on GitHub, inspired by the famous game show "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire). The application allows users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions, each associated with a specific prize amount. The goal is to accumulate as much virtual money as possible by answering questions correctly.

Key Features:

Multiple Levels: The game is structured into different levels, with each level featuring a set of questions of increasing difficulty.
Lifelines: Users can use predefined lifelines (e.g., "50:50," "Ask the Audience," "Phone a Friend") to seek assistance in answering questions.
Virtual Money: Each correct answer earns the player a virtual amount of money, and the difficulty of questions increases as the user progresses.
Leaderboard: Optionally, a leaderboard can be implemented to track the highest scorers.
Technologies Used:

* Language: Python
* Version Control: Git (GitHub)
* Random Question Generation: Questions can be generated randomly or fetched from predefined datasets.
* User Input Handling: Python's input() function for user interaction.
How to Play:

Users clone the GitHub repository to their local machine.
Run the Python script to start the game.
Answer a series of multiple-choice questions by inputting the corresponding option.
Use lifelines strategically to maximize earnings.
